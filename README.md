```js
var mquery = require('express-mquery');
var app = require('express');
...
//somwhere before your router definition add
app.use(mquery.middleware());

...

//somewhere in your controller/route use mquery object
app.get('/',function(request, response, next){
   Model
    .find(query, function(error, models){
        if(error){
            next(error);
        }
        else{
            respose.json(models;
        }
    }); 
});

//parse mquery using plugin
var UserSchema = new Schema({
    ...
});
UserSchema.plugin({limit:20});
...

//then exec query
var User = mongoose.model('User');
app.get('/',function(request, response, next){
   User
    .mquery(request);
    .exec(function(error, models){
        if(error){
            next(error);
        }
        else{
            respose.json(models;
        }
    });
